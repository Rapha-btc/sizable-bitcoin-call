(use-trait wrapped-btc-trait .sip010-ft-trait.sip010-ft-trait) ;; any wrapped btc that is a sip-10 token can be collateralized, and we are testing it here with sbtc.clar but I should have called it not-not-btc.clar in reference to Doctor $uss cultural meme

;; summary:
;; If the option expires in the money, there is no cash-settlement mechanism.  
;; The call owner would need to exercise the option and then sell the underlying asset on a market before the strike date.
;; SIP-018 could be used to facilitate a cash-settlement mechanism in the future. 

;; Note to self: designing an sBTC-covered call on the price of STX/BTC would be a good next step.  
;; Counterparty creates a call on the price of STX/BTC by locking up in the contract the sBTC amount equivalent to 100 STX.
;; Countterparty receives a SIP-009 token representing the call.
;; Strike is 1000 blocks in the future.
;; Then we can offer Bitcoiners to farm stacking rewards while being hedged against a drop in the price of STX/BTC.

;; USDA is now a more viable option compared to wrapped USDC, which was initially used due to its wider availability. 
;; This is because the launch of a stable swap on ALEX has stabilized the peg of USDA, while using wrapped USDC could actually hinder our efforts to mitigate counterparty risk.

;; The USDA token is a SIP-010 fungible token that is backed by the Arkadiko protocol. 
;; Collaterals backing USDA currently include STX, auto-Alex and xBTC.

;; description:

;; 1000 stx = 0.03051000 btc 
;; 1000 stx = 0.03050000 btc 
;; I want to buy a call on the price of STX such that if the price of STX drops to 0.03050000 BTC I will be able to exercise the call and receive 0.03050000 BTC.
;; currently 1000 stx = 0.03051000 btc (https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/stacks/btc)

;; let's take lots of 0.03000000 BTC (3m sats)
